# Jack-O-Lantern
Even though everyone and their mother seems to have their own Python NHL API scraper, this is my take on it. I mainly wanted to make this for practice and to custom develop it for my future analytic needs. The plan is for it to be more than just a scraper, but a shell for all scraping and information hosting/retrieval needs

## Why 'Jack-O-Lantern'?
Why not? Mainly cause I like to give fun names to my projects, but also because my middle name is Jack, last initial is O and like a pumpkin being made into a Jack-O-Lantern, you have to scoop out the insides (like a API scraper).
